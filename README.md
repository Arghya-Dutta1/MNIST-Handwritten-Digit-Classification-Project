# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) that are commonly used for training image processing systems. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the goal of this project is to classify the digits using machine learning models.

## Features
1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. Train different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Neural Networks) to classify digits.
3. Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.
4. Visualize predictions and misclassifications.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset can be easily loaded using popular libraries like tensorflow.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow or Keras for deep learning models
- Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the Repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

2. Install the Required Dependencies:
To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, the key dependencies are:
```console
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
```console
jupyter notebook Project_MNIST.ipynb
```
This will open the notebook in your browser, where you can execute all the cells.

## Results
The notebook outputs the accuracy of each model and visualizes predictions. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of around XX% on the test data (update with actual results).

## Future Improvements
1. Implement data augmentation to improve model generalization.
2. Experiment with more advanced deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
3. Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
